About
The Academy Vision ...


Bankless Academy was established by a core of passionate individuals with the vision of onboarding one-billion people to the Ethereum and Web3 ecosystems. We aim to become one of the ecosystem’s flagship “knowledge on-ramps” for the mass adoption of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance.



At the Academy, Users will learn about topics such as blockchain infrastructure, decentralized finance, NFT technology, and how to navigate the Web3 multiverse in a safe and secure way. Our Education Protocol aims to serve as the greater Web3 community as the open-source Public Good that guides students’ transformation from total rookie to becoming Bankless!

Such a transformation will be achieved primarily through the Academy’s fine-tuned lesson format that integrates essential reading with graphic and video elements to build the learner’s foundational understanding of advanced concepts.
